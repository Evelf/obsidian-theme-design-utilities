## Features

### Mobile Emulation
Conveniently enable the mobile emulation of Obsidian, i.e. how Obsidian would look on mobile. This helps with styling your theme for mobile.[^1]

### Freeze Obsidian
Freeze interaction with Obsidian, after a small delay. During that delay, you can create fleeting elements like context menus or tooltips which will stay on screen. (Note that this only works while the console is open.) To unfreeze Obsidian, simply click the "play" button which appeared at the top of Obsidian.

### Permanent Test Notice
Post a notice (notification) that stays on screen until you click it. This is useful for styling notices, as they normally quickly fade away.
