## Commands Added

### Mobile Emulation
Conveniently enable the mobile emulation of Obsidian, i.e. how Obsidian would look on mobile. This helps with styling your theme for mobile.

### Cycle between All Three Modes
Cycles between Source Mode, Live Preview, and Reading Mode. Set a hotkey to quickly check how the theme looks in all three view modes.

### Freeze Obsidian
Freeze interaction with Obsidian, after a small delay. During that delay, you can create fleeting elements like context menus or tooltips which will stay on screen. (Note that this only works while the console is open.) To unfreeze Obsidian, simply click the "play" button which appeared at the top of Obsidian.

### Permanent Test Notice
Post a notice (notification) that stays on screen until you click it. This is useful for styling notices, as they normally quickly fade away.

### Light/Dark Mode Toggle
A simple command to toggle between light and dark mode. Set a hotkey to quickly change the mode of the theme.

### CSS Feature Compatibility (Chrome Version)
Will display a notice with the current Chrome version utilized by Obsidian to render CSS. Sites like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) or [W3-Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_overflow-y.asp) usually document the minimum Chrome version required for a certain CSS feature at the bottom of the feature's documentation page.

### Cheatsheet
Open a cheat sheet showing the Obsidian CSS classes.
