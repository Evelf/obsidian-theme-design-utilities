## Features

### Mobile Emulation
Conveniently toggle emulation of the mobile version of Obsidian. This helps with styling your theme for mobile. (Basically, this plugin adds commands that run `app.emulateMobile(true);` and `app.emulateMobile(false);`)

### Permanent Notice
Post a notice (notification) that stays on screen until you click it. This is useful for styling notices, as they normally quickly fade away.
